2. I initially faced significant challenges in fitting my images within the buttons. In response to this issue, I took the time to learn about different types of images in CSS (inline-flex, inline-block, etc) to best fit my images. To solve the inconsistent sizing parameters, I custom-set each image's height and width and set their alignment in fixed positions on the screen. I wish I could have found more time to expand upon this sizing so that my game could be more mobile user-friendly, but it seemed to fix the issues of my buttons leaping off the screen whenever they were tapped! I also faced challenges in toggling the images to show and hide themselves based on mouse input. I first chose to do this through the onclick command instead of onmousedown and onmouseup, which led to a large bread crumb trail as the guess method called by onclick has so many potential spots in which to show and hide my button images! I found that finding bugs in allocating my command to different areas of the code and seeing firsthand the results they produced helped me better understand and visualize my code for future tasks. I implemented my other game features after initially including the images, and I found that navigating my file came much more naturally to me after this challenge! This same trend has held true in my other software projects in school, and overcoming hurdles such as the image sizing errors from this project helped me map out the project in my head and improved my performance in other areas and in similar tasks across all my programming languages and proficiencies. This project thoroughly helped me understand web development languages on a much deeper level!

3. I would love to see a class covered in our curriculum over web development and languages like CSS and HTML. I'd like to know how these higher-level languages map out to C++ and other languages that are more low-level in nature. From personally working with these languages through this activity, it seems they treat the user interface like a clean canvas rather than a series of instructions, which I found refreshing to work with coming from a background of back-end development and neural network construction in my classes and personal research projects. I originally found a passion for CS through studying human-computer interaction (HCI) and UI/UX, and I'd love to learn what intersections front-end web developers share with digital artists! This project enlightened me on just how difficult it is to develop an interface similar to a video game, so I kept a more minimalistic aesthetic to match my limited resources! As a former artist myself, if I were to practice web development in the future, I'd love to learn more about the sheer capabilities for eye-catching graphics and effective UI/UX designs!

4. Given more time, I would perfect the buttons and animate them to look more like a modern video game! I searched for ways to go above and beyond with my buttons and found an excellent glow method as well as an artificial "3D" looking interface from online resources, but I faced too many errors in trying to implement these fancy effects to resume with my vision. I've been particularly passionate about creating a positive and appealing UI/UX experience on all interfaces I've built before, so this would be my first priority if I had a few more hours to spare! I also wish I could have implemented a timer and score method, perhaps even a leaderboard with fake CPUs to challenge the user's competitive streak! I would have also enjoyed adding a widget for players to share their scores on social media automatically, though the configurations likely would have taken more than a couple of hours! Additionally, I faced an issue where buttons only responded correctly if directly clicked and not drag-clicked, even if it dragged for a pixel or two, and I would have loved to go back-end and debug this response. Lastly, given the opportunity, I would have loved to make my game more mobile-friendly, which would include keeping my buttons in a fixed position that would allow their orientation to shift based on the device's screen dimensions and orientation. It also could have included touch screen input, as I find that with memory games, muscle memory strongly comes into play with the user's cognitive process of reasoning through what to press at what time. All of these features could have made the game more fun, accessible and intuitive! Lastly, I would have loved to see this project in app form or have more functionality to turn my online game into an app, as I think it would also lend to a more intuitive and seamless user experience!
